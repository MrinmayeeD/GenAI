The Tacotron 2 model for generating mel spectrograms from text

Model Description
The Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow model form a text-to-speech system that enables user to synthesise a natural sounding speech from raw transcripts without any additional prosody information. The Tacotron 2 model produces mel spectrograms from input text using encoder-decoder architecture. WaveGlow (also available via torch.hub) is a flow-based model that consumes the mel spectrograms to generate speech.

This implementation of Tacotron 2 model differs from the model described in the paper. Our implementation uses Dropout instead of Zoneout to regularize the LSTM layers.

Example
In the example below:

pretrained Tacotron2 and Waveglow models are loaded from torch.hub
Given a tensor representation of the input text ("Hello world, I missed you so much"), Tacotron2 generates a Mel spectrogram as shown on the illustration
Waveglow generates sound given the mel spectrogram
the output sound is saved in an 'audio.wav' file
